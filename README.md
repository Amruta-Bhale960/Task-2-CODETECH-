Task 2: PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

Overview of the project:

Objectives:

•	Implement a linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variable.

•	Split the data into training and testing sets.

•	Train the model on the training data.

•	Evaluate the models performance using metrics like mean squared error(MSE) ,RMSE, and R-squared(R2).

•	Make prediction on the test set.

•	Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model accuracy.

Key Activities: 

1.Data Loading: Load the dataset using pandas.

2.Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and perform any necessary cleaning.
 
3.Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

4.Model Training: Train a linear regression model on the training data.

5.Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models performance using metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and R2.
  
6.Predictions: Make predictions on the test set.
   
7.Visualization: Plot regression line and visualize actual vs. predicted values.

Technology Used: 

Python: The programming language used for Analysis and modeling.

Pandas: For data manipulation and Analysis.

Numpy: For numerical Operations.

Scikit learn: For machine leraning algorithms and evaluation metrics.

Matplotlib: For creating graph & visualizations.

Seaborn: For statistical data visualization based on matplotlib.

Key Insights:

1. Model performance: The model performance is evaluated using MSE, RMSE and R2, which indicate how well the model fits the data.
   
2. Regression line: The regression line provides a visual representation of the relationship between the feature and the target variables.
   
3. Actual vs. predicted values: The scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values helps in assessing the model accuaracy and identifying any systematic errors.
